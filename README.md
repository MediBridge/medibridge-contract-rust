# MediBridge Contract

TODO: Add README

## DEPLOYING THE CONTRACT

1. Run `/build.sh` in the terminal - this will build the Smart Contract into wasm.
2. Run `/deploy.sh` to do a dev deploy of the smart contract. This will do a testnet deploy of the smart Contract.
3. Copy the contents of *neardev* folder for the frontend - This is optional and necessary if contract changes have to be made visible in the frontend.
